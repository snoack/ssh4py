# ssh4py (Python bindings for libssh2) were originally developed by     #
# Vincent Jaulin, and later forked and maintained by Sebastian Noack.   #
# Neither the original version nor this fork is maintained anymore.     #

# There will be no further support, updates or bug fixes from upstream. #
# Feel free to fork ssh4py, or consider alternatives.                   #
# For most applications, using OpenSSH through the subprocess module    #
# is the simplest, most reliable and most secure option.                #
#                                                                       #
